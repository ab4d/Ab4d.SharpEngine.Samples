Bitmap fonts generated by "Bitmap font generator" from https://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/

The font bitmap is created from latin, latin 1-suplement and latin extended-a charset.
Font size is 128 and rendered to 2048 x 2048 bitmap.

The configuration for the font generation is stored in the .bmfc files.

Note that each font has license.
Arial fonts may be only used on Windows.
Roboto and Secular One fonts are from Google's Open Font library and are more permissive (see license file for more info).

See comments in the Utilities\BitmapTextCreator.cs file for more info.
