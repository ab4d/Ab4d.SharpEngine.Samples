# MouseCameraController

Camera control is the main interface between the user and the 3D scene.

Therefore it is essential that this works smoothly and intuitively. 

MouseCameraController allows the user to rotate, move and zoom the camera with the mouse or with touch. It supports rotating around or zooming to a custom 3D position.
