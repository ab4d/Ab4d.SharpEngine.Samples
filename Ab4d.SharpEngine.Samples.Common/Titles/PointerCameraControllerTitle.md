# PointerCameraController

Camera control is the main interface between the user and the 3D scene.

Therefore it is essential that this works smoothly and intuitively. 

PointerCameraController allows the user to rotate, move and zoom the camera with the pointer or mouse. It supports rotating around or zooming to a custom 3D position.
