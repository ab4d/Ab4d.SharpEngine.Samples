# Graphs

The samples in the **Graphs** sections show how to create 3D graphs with Ab4d.SharpEngine.

The **AxisWithLabelsNode** can be used to create a single axis with a title and multiple 
value label. The AxisWithLabelsNode is highly customizable and can also automatically update 
the direction of the text when the camera is rotated.

The **AxisBoxNode** groups multiple AxisWithLabelsNode objects to show a 3D box with 
multiple axes that are shown and updated based on the selected **AxisShowingStrategy**.
